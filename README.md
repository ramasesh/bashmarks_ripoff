# bashmarks_ripoff
Implementation of bashmarks, based on the original

Original bashmarks, by [Huy Nguyen](https://github.com/huyng), can be found [here](https://github.com/huyng/bashmarks).  

Differences in implementations:
* In the original bashmarks, the bashmarks are stored as environmental variables of the form DIR_name.  In this implementation, we store the bashmarks in a bashmarks file, which gets checked every time a bashmark move is requested.
* The original features tab completion, which I have not implemented yet.
